:navtitle: Images

You can insert an image into any page in your site, regardless of the module or component version to which the target image file belongs.
On this page, you'll learn how to assign the correct resource ID coordinates to an image macro based on the version, component, and module the image belongs to in relation to the page where you want to embed it.

Images must be put inside an `images` folder for each _component_ and _module_ as shown in <<ex-co>>.
