= Module One Overview

This is version *{page-component-display-version}* of Module One in Component B.

== Page source

This page is sourced from [.path]_demo-component-b/docs/modules/module-one/pages/overview.adoc_.

== Cross reference syntax to target this page

To create a cross reference *to this page from another page in Module One*, the xref syntax would be `\xref:overview.adoc[]`.

To create a cross reference *to this page from a page in the ROOT module of Component B*, the xref syntax would be `\xref:module-one:overview.adoc[]`.

=== Always target the latest version of this page

To create a cross reference *to the latest version of this page from a page in Component A*, the xref syntax would be `\xref:component-b:module-one:overview.adoc[]`.

=== Target a specific version of this page

To create a cross reference *to version 1.0 of this page from a page in Component A*, the xref syntax would be `\xref:1.0@component-b:module-one:overview.adoc[]`.

== Family Directories and Families

Antora assigns preset, content-specific behavior to the source files stored in the family directories.

[#family-dir]
=== What's a family directory?

A [.term]*family directory* groups source files that share the same function, processing requirements, and publishing rules.
Antora recognizes five standard family directories: [.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, and [.path]_partials_.

      📁 images
      📁 pages
      📁 partials

Each family directory is optional.
You only need to create a family directory if you have source files that should be stored in a specific family directory.
That is, if a module doesn't have any image files, don't create an [.path]_images_ directory.
Set up the family directories you need at the root of a module directory.
At runtime, Antora collects the source files stored in the family directories and assigns them to the corresponding <<family,family>>.

[#family]
=== What's a family?

A [.term]*family* is a classification Antora applies to each source file collected from a family directory.
The assigned family corresponds to the name of the family directory.
The families are:

* attachments
* examples
* images
* pages
* partials

Each source file is configured, converted, and published according to the preset behavior associated with its assigned family.

TIP: A source file that is assigned to a family is often referred to as resource.
Antora assigns each resource that it catalogs a unique Antora resource ID that consists of five coordinates.
One coordinate of the resource ID represents the family of the resource.
